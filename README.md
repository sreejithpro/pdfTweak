# pdfTweak
Script for adding text into an existing PDF

This is a small example of using some libraries to edit PDF. Might be a stupid implementation but it works.

How to use
***********
Give the target directory and that's it. Script will make a directory called edited inside the target directory and stores the edited PDF inside it. 

By default the file name is being added as text. You can change it to anything. Loop works by iterating through files in the target directory.
